ðŸš€ Project Showcase: Virtual Hand-Tracking Keyboard

I built a real-time virtual keyboard that lets you type using just your hand gestures! ðŸ™Œ

Key Features:

Hand tracking using MediaPipe and OpenCV

Click-to-type with pinch gesture (index + thumb)

Supports Shift, Backspace, Enter, Space

Programmatic click sound â€“ no external files required

Pink keys with green highlight for visual feedback

ðŸ’» Tech Stack: Python | OpenCV | MediaPipe | PyAutoGUI | NumPy | SoundDevice

This project was a fun way to combine computer vision, human-computer interaction, and Python automation.
